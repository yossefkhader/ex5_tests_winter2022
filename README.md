# ex5_tests_winter2022

The tests are 2 types:
1. test 0 to 3 : Input/Output (Based on the document of the hw).
2. test 4 to 1001 : encrypt/decrypt (which tests the encryption without paying any attention to the right output).

The right path for the files:

:

:

├── tests/

|     └── ...

├── ex5.py

├── script.py

└── ....

to run the test use this command: python3.6 scrip.py.

feel free to add more test.

Thank to the KING Aseelkurdy for taking part in proccess of making the tests.
